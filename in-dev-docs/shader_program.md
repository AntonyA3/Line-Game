# Shader Program #
- I want to use opengl to extract variables that are in the program
- Try to get the properties of the variables from the shader text src, by using the openGL C++ API along with printing to string
- setMatrix func created
- Add the projection,view and model matrix to the shader program (addUniformAttribute function)
- std::map is not a hashmap however std::unordered_map is a hashmap
