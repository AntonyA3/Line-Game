# Log Window Design #

The log window is able to parse an object with properties, then render this object.

For Example it converts a Camera with
    - Position
    - Rotation
    - Fov
    - Aspect Ratio
    - Near
    - Far

to a 
    - Drop down tree for the camera
    - Text boxes for the property names.
