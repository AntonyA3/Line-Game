# Chosen Idea #
From thinking about the diffrent Ideas, I have decided that Line Runner is likely to be the best direction to take the new game. 
The reasons for not choosing Blue Sphere was that
- It was not able to work too well to expand the game in 3D without including features that may be seen as gimicks
- It has been done to a high quality already in sonic 3 and Knuclkles

For Not Choosing Streets in the Sky
- The scope will be too big.
- The game will require an understanding of complex architectural systems
- The game will require lost of testing to balance how money works in the game.

For Not Choosing Night Neon City
- The game will require narrative specific art to keep it engaging.
- Even though the game could be made with only a few people, there would need to be someone of another domain, therefore the scope is too big.


The main reasons that I have decided to go with LineRunner is the huge potential that there is, even with the game having a simple idea.
