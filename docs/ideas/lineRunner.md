# Line Runner #

## Concept and Goal ##
Similar to the game blue spheres in that the player is running on a 2D Plane, staying in the same direction, colllecting items that are required to complete the level, however, the player can fall of the line if they do not change the direction, this could lead to losing progress, of losing the level, some lines may have obstacles on them, and some lines may be destroyed after the player has traversed over it, either temporarily or permanently. Though the game logic is mostly 2D, the game contains spatial obstacles
