# Streets in the Sky #

## Concept and Goal ##
Streets in the sky is likely to be a 3D tower management game, in a vein that is similar to sim tower, however, rather than the game being a 2D side scroller game, it is a 3D Isometric game, that is based on the idea of having a plot of land, where you can build a skyscraper and plaza. There may be challenges in not being able to see every floor at once, however a minimap is something that may be available.
