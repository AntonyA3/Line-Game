# Task Manager Sub App #

This is a seperate application for keeping track of tasks and bugs that are in the application. This is because as the application grows, it will become harder to manage the markdown files that have list of tasks then add these tasks.

The Schema of the application, is most likely to fit the scehema of a relational database, since each task is uniquely identified, also bugs can be related to tasks as well. 

The end result should be a GUI application, that does create read and update operations. It will probably use ImGui as a dependancy as ImGui is both light weight and is as easy to use as a form related Gui application that would be made with html css and javascript.
